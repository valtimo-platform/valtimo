# Plugin Host

Node.js + Fastify sidecar that manages and executes external Wasm plugins via [Extism](https://extism.org/).

## What It Does

- Accepts plugin `.zip` uploads (containing `manifest.json` + `plugin.wasm`)
- Persists plugins to disk and plugin metadata to PostgreSQL
- Stores plugin configurations in PostgreSQL (survives restarts)
- Executes plugin actions by calling into the Wasm module and returning process variables
- Consumes platform events from RabbitMQ and delivers each to plugins that subscribe to it
  (`handle_event`) — see [Events](#events)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+
- Docker (for database and containerized deployment)

## Quick Start (Recommended)

Run the host locally with only PostgreSQL in Docker. This works seamlessly with GZAC's RabbitMQ
since both use `localhost`.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev    # Starts db container + app with auto-reload
```

That's it. The database starts automatically and the host listens on port 8090.

### Full Docker Deployment

For production or isolated testing, run everything in Docker:

```bash
npm run build
ADMIN_TOKEN=my-secret npm run docker:up
```

Note: When running fully containerized, GZAC must push `eventBroker.amqpUrl` using
`host.docker.internal` instead of `localhost` to reach the host machine's RabbitMQ.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ADMIN_TOKEN` | yes | `changeme` (Docker) | Shared secret used as the HMAC key authenticating every GZAC→host request (see [API Reference](#api-reference)) |
| `PORT` | no | `8090` | HTTP listen port |
| `PLUGIN_STORAGE_DIR` | no | `./plugins` (local), `/data/plugins` (Docker) | Directory for persisted plugin binaries |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | no | `info` | `debug`, `info`, `warn`, or `error` |
| `HOST_ID` | no | OS hostname | Identity of this logical host; names its per-host event queue. Replicas of the **same** host must share one value (see [Events](#events)). |
| `DB_HOST` | no | `localhost` | PostgreSQL host |
| `DB_PORT` | no | `5434` | PostgreSQL port |
| `DB_NAME` | no | `pluginhost` | PostgreSQL database name |
| `DB_USER` | no | `pluginhost` | PostgreSQL username |
| `DB_PASSWORD` | no | `pluginhost` | PostgreSQL password |
| `TLS_CERT_PATH` | no | — | PEM certificate. Set **together with** `TLS_KEY_PATH` to make the host serve HTTPS (see [Transport security](#transport-security)). |
| `TLS_KEY_PATH` | no | — | PEM private key. Set together with `TLS_CERT_PATH`. |
| `TLS_CA_PATH` | no | — | PEM CA / intermediate chain, when the certificate file is not self-contained. |

The host does **not** configure an event broker. Each GZAC instance pushes its own broker connection
alongside every configuration (see [Events](#events)), so one host can serve many GZAC instances,
each on its own broker.

## Transport security

Every GZAC→host request is HMAC-SHA256 signed (see [API Reference](#api-reference)). HMAC
authenticates the caller and integrity-binds the request, so a push cannot be forged or replayed —
but it does **not** encrypt the payload. The configuration push carries the broker AMQP URL, its
credentials, and the per-config service token in its body, so confidentiality of those secrets
depends on the transport.

Set `TLS_CERT_PATH` and `TLS_KEY_PATH` (both together) to make the host serve HTTPS and encrypt the
channel end-to-end; add `TLS_CA_PATH` when the certificate is not self-contained. Both must be set
or the host refuses to start (half-configured TLS would otherwise silently fall back to plain HTTP).
GZAC must then be configured with an `https://` base URL for the host, and the host's certificate
must be trusted by GZAC's JVM truststore (a CA-signed certificate, or the host CA imported into the
truststore).

Plain HTTP is fine when TLS is terminated by a reverse proxy in front of the host, or for local
development on `localhost`. To keep secrets off an eavesdroppable link, **GZAC refuses to register a
host that carries event-broker credentials unless that host is reachable over HTTPS** (or a loopback
address such as `localhost`/`127.0.0.1` for local development). Hosts without a broker (actions only)
may still be registered over plain HTTP.

## Persistence

| Data | Storage | Location |
|------|---------|----------|
| Plugin configurations | PostgreSQL | `plugin_configurations` table |
| Plugin metadata | PostgreSQL | `plugins` table |
| Plugin binaries (.wasm, manifest, frontend assets) | Filesystem | `PLUGIN_STORAGE_DIR` (Docker: `/data/plugins` volume) |

Configurations persist across host restarts. Event consumers automatically reconnect to brokers
referenced by persisted configurations on startup.

## Events

A GZAC instance publishes domain events through its transactional outbox as CloudEvents v1.0 JSON to
a RabbitMQ exchange (`valtimo-events`, fanout). Because a single host serves multiple GZAC instances
— each with its own broker — the **host never configures a broker itself**. Instead, each instance
pushes its broker connection (`eventBroker`) alongside every configuration on
`POST/PUT /api/host/configurations/:configId`:

```json
{
  "pluginId": "case-summary",
  "pluginVersion": "0.1.0",
  "properties": { "currency": "EUR" },
  "serviceToken": "…",
  "gzacBaseUrl": "http://localhost:8080",
  "eventBroker": {
    "amqpUrl": "amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672",
    "exchange": "valtimo-events",
    "exchangeType": "fanout",
    "queueMode": "live",
    "queueTtlMs": null
  }
}
```

The host opens **one consumer per distinct broker** and tears it down when no configuration
references it any more. `exchange` defaults to `valtimo-events` and `exchangeType` to `fanout`; omit
`eventBroker` (or its `amqpUrl`) to disable events for a configuration. Each broker's events are
routed only to configurations carrying that same broker.

**Multiple hosts per instance.** The exchange is a fanout, so the host binds its **own** queue —
`valtimo-external-plugins.<exchange>.<HOST_ID>.<queueMode>`. This means:

- *Different* hosts on the same GZAC instance each have a distinct queue, so **every host receives a
  copy** of every event.
- *Replicas of the same host* (same `HOST_ID`) bind the **same** queue and become competing
  consumers, so each event is handled by exactly **one** replica — set a shared `HOST_ID` across
  replicas to get this load-balancing (the default OS hostname makes each replica distinct, which
  would double-handle).

**Queue durability modes.** The GZAC admin chooses, per host:

| `queueMode` | Queue arguments | Behavior |
|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| `live` (default) | `durable:false, autoDelete:true` | Queue evaporates when the host disconnects. Events published while the host is fully down are **lost**. |
| `durable` | `durable:true, autoDelete:false`, `x-expires=queueTtlMs` | Queue survives host restarts. Buffered events are replayed on reconnect, up to `queueTtlMs` of no-consumer inactivity (then the queue is deleted). |

The mode is included in the queue name, so flipping the mode never collides with the previous
queue's arguments — the old `.live` queue auto-deletes on disconnect, while an orphan `.durable`
queue lingers until `x-expires` fires or an operator deletes it.

`queueTtlMs` is validated on the GZAC side between 1 hour and 30 days; default 72 hours. Use a
short value (e.g. 1h) for fast local feedback when testing the durability flow; pick a longer one in
production based on the maximum downtime you want to tolerate without losing events.

Round trip:

1. A GZAC instance emits an event (e.g. `com.ritense.valtimo.task.completed`,
   `com.ritense.valtimo.document.viewed`) → outbox → its `valtimo-events` exchange.
2. The host's consumer for that broker reads the CloudEvent and, for every configuration on that
   broker whose manifest lists the event's `type` under `eventSubscriptions`, invokes the plugin's
   `handle_event` export.
3. The handler runs in the Extism sandbox with the configuration's properties injected and the
   per-configuration service token available, so it can call back into that GZAC instance via
   `gzac_api`.

A plugin declares its subscriptions in `manifest.json`:

```json
"eventSubscriptions": [
  "com.ritense.valtimo.task.completed",
  "com.ritense.valtimo.document.viewed"
]
```

and registers a handler with the SDK's `onEvent`:

```ts
import { onEvent } from "@valtimo/plugin-sdk";
onEvent((event) => { /* event.type, event.resultId, event.result, ... */ });
```

## API Reference

Every GZAC→host request is authenticated with an **HMAC-SHA256 signature**, not a bearer token. The
signature is computed over the canonical string `{METHOD}\n{path}\n{timestamp}\n{bodyHash}` keyed
with the `ADMIN_TOKEN`, where:

- `path` is the request path without the query string;
- `bodyHash` is `SHA-256(body)` hex — the empty string for GET/DELETE, and the **uploaded file
  bytes** (not the multipart envelope) for the plugin upload;
- `timestamp` is an ISO-8601 instant; the host rejects anything more than **±5 minutes** from its
  own clock (replay protection).

It is sent as two headers: `X-Valtimo-Signature` (the hex HMAC) and `X-Valtimo-Timestamp`. In
production GZAC's `ExternalPluginHostClient` signs every call automatically. To call the host by
hand, sign with this helper (requires `openssl`):

```bash
ADMIN_TOKEN=test-secret
# host_sign METHOD PATH [BODY_FILE]  →  sets $TS and $SIG for the curl calls below
host_sign() {
  TS="$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)"
  local hash
  hash="$(openssl dgst -sha256 -hex "${3:-/dev/null}" | awk '{print $NF}')"
  SIG="$(printf '%s\n%s\n%s\n%s' "$1" "$2" "$TS" "$hash" \
    | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac "$ADMIN_TOKEN" -hex | awk '{print $NF}')"
}
```

`GET /health` is the only unauthenticated route.

### `GET /health`

```bash
curl -sS http://localhost:8090/health | jq .
```

### `GET /api/host/plugins` — list all loaded plugins

```bash
host_sign GET /api/host/plugins
curl -sS http://localhost:8090/api/host/plugins \
  -H "X-Valtimo-Timestamp: $TS" -H "X-Valtimo-Signature: $SIG" | jq .
```

### `GET /api/host/plugins/:pluginId` — list all versions of a plugin

```bash
host_sign GET /api/host/plugins/say-hello
curl -sS http://localhost:8090/api/host/plugins/say-hello \
  -H "X-Valtimo-Timestamp: $TS" -H "X-Valtimo-Signature: $SIG" | jq .
```

### `POST /api/host/plugins` — upload plugin `.zip` (multipart)

The signature binds the **file bytes**, so sign the `.zip` itself:

```bash
host_sign POST /api/host/plugins ../sample-plugins/say-hello/dist/say-hello-0.1.0.zip
curl -sS -X POST http://localhost:8090/api/host/plugins \
  -H "X-Valtimo-Timestamp: $TS" -H "X-Valtimo-Signature: $SIG" \
  -F "file=@../sample-plugins/say-hello/dist/say-hello-0.1.0.zip" | jq .
```

### `DELETE /api/host/plugins/:pluginId/:version` — remove a plugin

```bash
host_sign DELETE /api/host/plugins/say-hello/0.1.0
curl -sS -X DELETE http://localhost:8090/api/host/plugins/say-hello/0.1.0 \
  -H "X-Valtimo-Timestamp: $TS" -H "X-Valtimo-Signature: $SIG" -w "\nHTTP %{http_code}\n"
```

### `GET /api/host/configurations` — list all configurations

```bash
host_sign GET /api/host/configurations
curl -sS http://localhost:8090/api/host/configurations \
  -H "X-Valtimo-Timestamp: $TS" -H "X-Valtimo-Signature: $SIG" | jq .
```

### `POST /api/host/configurations/:configId` — push configuration

`serviceToken` and `gzacBaseUrl` are required — the host uses them to authenticate and route the
plugin's API callbacks. For local testing any non-empty string works for `serviceToken`. Write the
body to a file so the signed bytes and the sent bytes match exactly (`--data-binary @file`):

```bash
cat > /tmp/config.json <<'JSON'
{"pluginId":"say-hello","pluginVersion":"0.1.0","properties":{"greeting":"Hello"},"serviceToken":"local-test-token","gzacBaseUrl":"http://localhost:8080"}
JSON
host_sign POST /api/host/configurations/my-config /tmp/config.json
curl -sS -X POST http://localhost:8090/api/host/configurations/my-config \
  -H "X-Valtimo-Timestamp: $TS" -H "X-Valtimo-Signature: $SIG" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data-binary @/tmp/config.json | jq .
```

### `PUT /api/host/configurations/:configId` — update configuration

```bash
printf '%s' '{"properties":{"greeting":"Hola"}}' > /tmp/config.json
host_sign PUT /api/host/configurations/my-config /tmp/config.json
curl -sS -X PUT http://localhost:8090/api/host/configurations/my-config \
  -H "X-Valtimo-Timestamp: $TS" -H "X-Valtimo-Signature: $SIG" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data-binary @/tmp/config.json | jq .
```

### `DELETE /api/host/configurations/:configId` — remove configuration

```bash
host_sign DELETE /api/host/configurations/my-config
curl -sS -X DELETE http://localhost:8090/api/host/configurations/my-config \
  -H "X-Valtimo-Timestamp: $TS" -H "X-Valtimo-Signature: $SIG" -w "\nHTTP %{http_code}\n"
```

### `POST /plugins/:pluginId/:version/actions/:actionKey` — execute an action

```bash
printf '%s' '{"configurationId":"my-config","processInstanceId":"p1","documentId":"d1","activityId":"a1","properties":{"recipient":"World"}}' > /tmp/action.json
host_sign POST /plugins/say-hello/0.1.0/actions/say-hello /tmp/action.json
curl -sS -X POST http://localhost:8090/plugins/say-hello/0.1.0/actions/say-hello \
  -H "X-Valtimo-Timestamp: $TS" -H "X-Valtimo-Signature: $SIG" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data-binary @/tmp/action.json | jq .
```

### `GET /plugins/:pluginId/:version/plugin-manifest` — get plugin manifest

```bash
curl -sS http://localhost:8090/plugins/say-hello/0.1.0/plugin-manifest | jq .
```
