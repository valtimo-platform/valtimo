## New Features

* **New feature title**

  New feature explanation.

## Enhancements

* **Dashboard case widgets only count cases you are allowed to see**

  Widgets that show case counts used to include every case in the system. They now count only the cases you may
  view, so the numbers match what you see in the case list.

## Bugfixes


* **Form flow steps with a colon in their expressions work again after import**

  Importing a case no longer breaks form flow steps whose start or complete expression contains a colon, such as one
  that saves submission data to a document or process variable. These steps stopped working after import because part
  of the expression was cut off.

* **Object permissions are checked before the object is retrieved**

  A user without permission to view objects is now refused before anything is requested from the Objecten API.
  Previously the object was retrieved first, so the answer of the Objecten API could tell such a user whether an
  object exists.

## Security

* **Permission checks only accept known resource types**

  When Valtimo was asked whether a user may perform an action, the resource type in that question was taken at
  face value, which allowed any signed-in user to make the server load arbitrary internal parts of the
  application. Only the resource types that can be selected under **Access control** are accepted now, and
  anything else is answered as "not permitted", so normal use is unaffected.
