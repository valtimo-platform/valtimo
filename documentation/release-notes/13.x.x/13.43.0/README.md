## New Features

* **New feature title**

  New feature explanation.

## Enhancements

* **New enhancement title**

  New enhancement explanation.

* **Case inspection shows the case definition key and version**

  The metadata tab of the case inspection page now shows the key and version of the case definition the case was
  created from. Only the name of the document definition was shown before, which made it impossible to tell which
  version of a case definition a case belongs to.

## Bugfixes

* **Searching on a date returns results again**

  Picking a date in a search field, such as **Geboortedatum** under **Achternaam en geboortedatum** in a Beelden
  search, passed the date on in a format the external source did not accept, so the search stayed empty.

* **The image widget no longer offers task fields it cannot show**

  The value picker of an image widget offered `task:` fields such as the assignee or the due date, even
  though a widget has no task to read them from. Choosing one produced a widget that failed to render.
  Existing image widgets that use a `task:` field must be changed to use a case or document field.
