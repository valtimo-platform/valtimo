## New Features

* **New feature title**

  New feature explanation.

## Enhancements

* **New enhancement title**

  New enhancement explanation.

* **Case inspection shows the case definition key and version**

  The metadata tab of the case inspection page now shows the key and version of the case definition the case was
  created from. Only the name of the document definition was shown before, which made it impossible to tell which
  version of a case definition a case belongs to.

## Bugfixes

* **Searching on a date returns results again**

  Picking a date in a search field, such as **Geboortedatum** under **Achternaam en geboortedatum** in a Beelden
  search, passed the date on in a format the external source did not accept, so the search stayed empty.

* **Forms shown in a widget are included in the case export**

  Exporting a case now also exports the form definitions that are used by form widgets on a widget tab. These forms
  were missing from the export, which made the resulting case file impossible to import: the import stopped with the
  message that the form definition could not be found.
