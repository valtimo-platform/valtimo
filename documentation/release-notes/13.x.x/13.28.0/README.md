# 13.28.0

{% hint style="info" %}
**Release date 13-05-2026**
{% endhint %}

## New Features

* **Dutch address support in map widgets**

  The map widget can now render a layer that points at a Dutch address object instead of a GeoJSON geometry. Valtimo
  geocodes the address to a WGS84 coordinate via
  the [PDOK Locatieserver](https://api.pdok.nl/bzk/locatieserver/search/v3_1/ui/) and renders the result as a `Point`.
  See the [Map widget documentation](../../../features/case/tabs/widgets.md) for the full list of recognised fields and
  a configuration example.


## Enhancements

* **Open widget link in a new browser tab**

  Link-type action buttons on case widgets now support an "Open in new tab" option in widget management.
  When enabled, clicking the button opens the configured URL in a new browser tab instead of replacing
  the case detail page.

## Bugfixes

* When a header widget was configured, it was not possible to edit the header widget.
