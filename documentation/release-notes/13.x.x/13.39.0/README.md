## Bugfixes

* **Tooltips no longer stay on screen when the hovered element is removed**

  A tooltip shown for an element that was removed or re-rendered while hovered (for example on pages that
  refresh their data periodically, such as the OpenSearch reindex overview) stayed visible on screen
  permanently. The tooltip is now cleaned up together with its element.

* **List rows keep their state during periodic data refreshes**

  Lists that refresh their data periodically re-created their rows on every refresh, causing expanded rows,
  tooltips and hover state to flicker or reset. Rows with a stable identity (such as lists using an expanded
  row key) are now updated in place, so the view stays stable while the data refreshes.

* **Consistent Dutch terminology for cases**

  Several Dutch interface texts used *zaak* where the standard term *dossier* applies, among others in the
  OpenSearch and generic case list feature toggles, case statuses and tags, retention settings, the metroline
  widget and access control. These texts now consistently use *dossier*. Dutch ZGW-related terms (such as
  *zaaktype* and *zaaknummer*) are unchanged.

* **Sorting on columns in the case list**
  
  When sorting the columns, the default sorting would not be respected in some cases.
  Additionally, when open search was used, sorting did not work. These issues have now been resolved.
