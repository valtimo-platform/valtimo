## Bugfixes

| Area | Fix |
|------|-----|
| Forms | Clicking the submit button of a form more than once no longer submits the form multiple times; after a failed submit the button can be used again. |
| Case widgets | A process button on a widget respects access rules based on the case's status, instead of staying hidden while the same process could be started under **Start** |

## Security

| Severity | Fix |
|----------|-----|
| High | The process instance search and count endpoints no longer let any logged-in user list the process instances of all cases or search their process variables. They are now only available to administrators. The search endpoints and the count by process definition name will be removed in a future version. |
| Medium | Adding a comment to a process instance is now only available to administrators, and will be removed in a future version. |
| Medium | Deploying a version of a process definition with shortened timers is now only available to administrators, and will be removed in a future version. |
