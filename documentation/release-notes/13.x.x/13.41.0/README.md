## Bugfixes

* **A divider widget without a title no longer shows a dash**

  A divider widget that is configured without a title now stays empty, both in the widget list on the
  widget management page and on the widget tab of a case. Previously a `-` was shown in both places as a
  placeholder for the missing title. In addition, saving a divider without a title on an IKO view no longer
  fails: the back end required a non-blank title for every widget, while a divider does not need one.

* **A divider widget can be duplicated again**

  Fixed an issue where duplicating a divider opened the duplication dialog with an empty, invalid key that 
  could not be edited, leaving the Duplicate button disabled. The dialog now pre-populates the divider key 
  with a unique default value and allows it to be edited before duplicating.
  
* **Start form of a building block now opens in the panel**

  Starting a building block from the 'Start' menu of a case did nothing when the start form of its
  main process is configured to be shown in a panel. The panel now opens right away. Previously it
  only appeared after first opening the start form of a regular process in the panel.
