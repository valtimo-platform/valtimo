## Bugfixes

* **A divider widget without a title no longer shows a dash**

  A divider widget that is configured without a title now stays empty, both in the widget list on the
  widget management page and on the widget tab of a case. Previously a `-` was shown in both places as a
  placeholder for the missing title. In addition, saving a divider without a title on an IKO view no longer
  fails: the back end required a non-blank title for every widget, while a divider does not need one.

* **A divider widget can be duplicated again**

  Duplicating a divider was impossible because it opened the duplication modal with an empty (invalid) key
  and no way to edit this key. This resulted in a disabled *Duplicate* button. The divider key is now always
  filled with a default unique value, and it is possible to edit the key before duplicating it.
  
* **Start form of a building block now opens in the panel**

  Starting a building block from the 'Start' menu of a case did nothing when the start form of its
  main process is configured to be shown in a panel. The panel now opens right away. Previously it
  only appeared after first opening the start form of a regular process in the panel.
